  create child nodes describing particular reserved (excluded from normal use)
  memory regions. Such memory regions are usually designed for the special

  of reserved memory. Each child node may either use a 'reg' property to
  specify a specific range of reserved memory, or a 'size' property with
  optional constraints to request a dynamically allocated block of
  memory.
